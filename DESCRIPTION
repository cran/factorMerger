Description: 
    The Merging Path Plot is a methodology for adaptive fusing of k-groups 
    with likelihood-based model selection. This package contains tools for 
    exploration and visualization of k-group dissimilarities. 
    Comparison of k-groups is one of the most important issues
    in exploratory analyses and it has zillions of applications. 
    The traditional approach is to use pairwise post hoc tests
    in order to verify which groups differ significantly. However, 
    this approach fails with a large number of groups in both interpretation 
    and visualization layer.
    The Merging Path Plot solves this problem by using an easy-to-understand 
    description of dissimilarity among groups based on Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) statistic (Sitko, Biecek 2017) <arXiv:1709.04412>.
    'factorMerger' is a part of the 'DrWhy.AI' universe (Biecek 2018) <arXiv:1806.08915>.
